        <div id="left">
            <p>For as long as Aml can remember, art has been a strong
                passion of hers. Even though many children grow up painting
                and drawing, creating art was a hobby that remained even
                as she got older. While studying Business Management in
                2017, she decided to take the initiative to expand her art skills
                and see where it might take her. She started by painting Arabic
                Calligraphy, and was later inspired to explore different mediums
                and art styles such as oil paintings, portraits, landscapes, and
                abstract art. </p>

            <p> In 2019, she was given the opportunity to step out of her
                comfort zone and paint murals in various establishments in
                the GTA, where she gained interest in a different art style.
                She appreciates art because it allows her to express her
                emotions and she finds inspiration through the people around
                her and everything she has experienced.
